## Community Support

Whilst Community Support offers no guarantees, there are two places to ask questions if you're getting stuck and want to see if someone in the community could help you:

* We have >1,300 developers in [our public Slack group](../slack).
* Feel free to open an issue in our [main project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog).

We are very grateful for folks that do this the other way around and help answer others' questions. You may just end up with some [merch](https://merch.posthog.com/) for particularly good answers :)

## Dedicated Slack

Our preference is to support customers through a private Slack channel. This is because it

From our side we will add as a minimum:

* Customer Success contact (whoever you spoke with ahead of becomign a paying customer)
* Support hero engineer (we have an on call engineer between 2am PT / 9am GMT and 5pm PT / 12am GMT)
* Platform team engineers (help with deeper infrastructure or ingestion questions)
* Product manager (helps us to understand feature requests, or can clarify current feature set)

From your side, we recommend you add:

* A stakeholder from engineering
* A stakeholder from data engineering / data analysis if relevant
* A stakeholder from product management
* 2-3 power users
* A stakeholder from customer success if relevant
* A stakeholder from sales if relevant

## Dedicated Email

For larger customers that can't use Slack easily, we can offer priority email support instead.
